# Project Description

This project analyzes car accident data from the United States in 2020 and 2021 in an attempt to identify possible relationships with various factors. The data used was primarily contained within a csv file found on Kaggle called "US Accidents (2016-2021), as well as API calls to the Census and Gmaps APIs.

The following areas were explored and compared with the relative frequency of car accidents by location across the United States:

-Median Income by County

-Median Age by County

-Time of Day/Year

-Weather
